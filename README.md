# Getting Started @bentah/schematics

Run on an Angular project generated by the Angular CLI in version 6+.

```shell
$ npm install @bentah/schematics
```

## List of schematics 

* [Tooling-git](#tooling-git)
* [Lite server](#lite-server)
* [webpack-analyser-bundle](#webpack-analyser-bundle)


### <a name="tooling-git"></a> Tooling Git

This schematics will install the following librairies and configure your app to use them : 
* [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky): To use git hooks
* [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli): To format your git commits
* [cz-customizable](https://github.com/leonardoanalista/cz-customizable): A customizable commitizen adapter
* [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged): To run linters against staged git files and don't let ðŸ’© slip into your code base!
* [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier): An opinionated code formatter

```shell
$ ng g @bentah/schematics:tooling-git
```

Then you will have to use **npm run commit** to perform your commits. 

What happen when you use npm run commit ? 

First, thanks to husky, a **precommit** hook will be run. It will launch **lint-staged** in order to perform tslint and prettier on the staged files.
Then, thanks to commitizen, you'll be prompted to fill in any required fields and your commit messages will be formatted according to the standards.

Enjoy ðŸ‘Œ
